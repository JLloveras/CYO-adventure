        <br>
        <p>Awakening within a cell, there are three things we quickly notice.</p>
        <br>
        <div id="page-1">
            <ol>
                <li>We are underground, presumably in a dungeon</li>
                <li>We were supposed to be imprisoned here, as noted by the iron shackles.</li>
                <li>The iron shackles are broken.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>Currently, there seems to be two options.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="hidden-text">It's all lies. Only one option exists.</p>
        <div>
            <button id="button-left">Look for a way out</button>
            <button id="button-right">Wait for something to happen</button>
        </div>
